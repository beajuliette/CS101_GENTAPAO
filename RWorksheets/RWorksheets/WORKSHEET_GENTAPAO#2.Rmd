## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# 1. Create a vector using : operator

```{r q1a}
# 1a. Sequence from -5 to 5
seq_neg5_to_5 <- -5:5
seq_neg5_to_5
```
**Output:** -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  0  1  2  3  4  5

**Description:** The : operator creates a sequence of integers from -5 to 5 with increments of 1. It produces 11 elements total.

```{r q1b}
# 1b. x <- 1:7. What will be the value of x?
x <- 1:7
x
```
**Output:** 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

**Description:** x contains integers from 1 to 7

# 2. Create a vector using seq() function

```{r q2}
# 2a. seq(1, 3, by=0.2)
seq_result <- seq(1, 3, by=0.2)
seq_result
```
**Output:** 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0

**Description:** The seq() function creates a sequence from 1 to 3 with a step size of 0.2. It generates 11 elements, incrementing by 0.2 each time.

# 3. Factory census of workers

```{r q3-setup}
# Workers' ages
workers_age <- c(34, 28, 22, 36, 27, 18, 52, 39, 42, 29, 35, 31, 27,
                 22, 37, 34, 19, 20, 57, 49, 50, 37, 46, 25, 17, 37, 
                 43, 53, 41, 51, 35, 24, 33, 41, 53, 40, 18, 44, 38, 
                 41, 48, 27, 39, 19, 30, 61, 54, 58, 26, 18)
```

```{r q3a}
# 3a. Access 3rd element
workers_age[3]
```
**Output:** 22

```{r q3b}
# 3b. Access 2nd and 4th element
workers_age[c(2, 4)]
```
**Output:** 28 36

```{r q3c}
# 3c. Access all but the 1st element
workers_age[-1]
```
**Output:** 28 22 36 27 18 52 39 42 29 35 31 27 22 37 34 19 20 57 49 50 37 46 25 17 37 43 53 41 51 35 24 33 41 53 40 18 44 38 41 48 27 39 19 30 61 54 58 26 18

**Description:** This returns all elements except the first one (34 is excluded)

# 4. Create a named vector

```{r q4}
x <- c("first"=3, "second"=0, "third"=9)
names(x)
```
**Output:** "first"  "second" "third"

```{r q4a}
# 4a. Print results and access x[c("first", "third")]
print(x)

x[c("first", "third")]
```
**Output:** 
```
first second  third 
    3      0      9

first third 
    3     9
```

**Description:** This accesses the elements named "first" and "third" from the named vector, returning their values (3 and 9).

# 5. Create a sequence x from -3:2

```{r q5}
x <- -3:2
x
```
**Output:** -3 -2 -1  0  1  2

```{r q5a}
# 5a. Modify 2nd element and change it to 0
x[2] <- 0
x
```
**Output:** -3  0 -1  0  1  2

**Description:** The second element (originally -2) is changed to 0. The vector now has -3 as first element, 0 as second element, and continues with -1, 0, 1, 2.

# 6. Diesel fuel purchased by Mr. Cruz

```{r q6a}
# 6a. Create a data frame
month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "March", "Apr", "May", "June")
price_per_liter <- c(52.50, 57.25, 60.00, 65.00, 74.25, 54.00)
purchase_quantity <- c(25, 30, 40, 50, 10, 45)

fuel_data <- data.frame(
  Month = month,
  Price_per_liter_PhP = price_per_liter,
  Purchase_quantity_Liters = purchase_quantity
)

print(fuel_data)
```

```{r q6b}
# 6b. Average fuel expenditure
average_expenditure <- weighted.mean(price_per_liter, purchase_quantity)
average_expenditure
```
**Output:** 59.2625

**Description:** This represents the weighted average price per liter based on purchase quantity

# 7. Built-in dataset: rivers

```{r q7a}
# 7a. Create a vector data with 7 elements
data <- c(length(rivers), sum(rivers), mean(rivers), median(rivers), 
          var(rivers), sd(rivers), min(rivers), max(rivers))
```

```{r q7b}
# 7b. Results
data
```
**Output:** 141.0000 83357.0000 591.1844 425.0000 243908.4086 493.8708 135.0000 3710.0000
